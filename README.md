# Back End
## 1. General description
The modules in this block provide on hearth back end services to the rest of the modules of the DEE. These services include time consuming computations and data storage and retrieval. The modules are developed in Python.
Each of the modules in this block has a GitHub repo where you can find the code together with a description, installation instructions and demos. These are the repos:

* *Ground API REST*:
